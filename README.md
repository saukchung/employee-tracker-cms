# Employee Database Manager

## Description
    
In order for the user to keep track of employees who have different managers in charge, who have different roles which belong to different departments. Very difficult to see in a glance all the departments, roles, and employees. And what happens if the user needs to add another department, role or a new employee? Disaster.		
This app was developed with the needs of those who need to keep track of all these things:

Employee's name, role, and manager

Role's title, salary, department

Department's name
    
## Installation
    
Once the folder has been cloned down, open the terminal at the file location and run "npm i" in order to get all the necessary dependencies. 

Once that is complete, type in "cd db", and once in the db folder, run sql by typing "mysql -u root -p" and type in your sql password. Then type "source schema.sql".

Open the server.js and type in your sql password in line 12.

Open the terminal again at the root of the folder.

Finally, type in "npm start" in order to start the application.
